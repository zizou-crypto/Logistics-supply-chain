# Shipment Performance Analysis Dashboard
1. Project Overview
Description: This project involves the development of an interactive dashboard using Power BI to analyze shipment performance data. The dashboard provides insights into key metrics such as total shipments, customer and supplier activity, shipment efficiency, delivery times, and delays. The analysis aims to help stakeholders understand shipment trends, identify areas for improvement in logistics operations, and make data-driven decisions to optimize delivery processes.
Purpose: The primary purpose of this project is to:
- Visualize key shipment performance indicators.
- Identify trends and patterns in shipment data.
- Enable users to explore and filter data to gain specific insights.
- Provide a tool for monitoring and improving logistics efficiency.
Target Audience: The dashboard is designed for a broad audience, including:
- Logistics managers
- Supply chain analysts
- Operations personnel
- Decision-makers involved in shipment and delivery processes
2. Skills Demonstrated
This project showcases the following data analyst skills:
- Data Visualization: Creating effective and interactive visualizations using Power BI to communicate complex information clearly.
- Data Analysis: Analyzing shipment data to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilizing DAX to create calculated columns and measures for in-depth analysis (e.g., calculating shipment efficiency, average distance, and delay hours).
- Data Interpretation: Interpreting the visualized data to provide meaningful insights and recommendations.
- Dashboard Design: Designing a user-friendly and intuitive dashboard layout for easy navigation and data exploration.
- Data Cleaning and Transformation: (Assumed) Preparing the data for analysis, including cleaning, transforming, and loading it into Power BI.  (If you used Power Query, be sure to document those steps in section 4)
- Problem Solving: Addressing a real-world business problem by providing a data-driven solution.
3. Project Details
Tools Used:
- Power BI Desktop: For data connection, modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard creation.
- Data Sources: 
Sample shipment data was provided in the form of a Xlxs file.  The data included shipment details such as shipment ID, customer ID, supplier ID, origin and destination, distance, shipment date, delivery date, material shipped, and delay hours.
- Key Metrics Analyzed:
1. Total Shipments
2. Total Customers
3. Total Suppliers
4. Average Distance
5. Shipment Efficiency
6. Customer Repetition
7. Utilization
8. Delay Hours
9. Delivery Time by Material Shipped
10. Total Shipments and Average Delay Hours by Material Shipped

- Visualizations Created: 

KPI cards to display key metrics at a glance.

Bar charts to visualize delivery time by material shipped.

Line chart to show total shipments and average delay hours by material shipped.

Map visualization to show average distance covered by shipment route.

Tables to display customer details.

Slicers for filtering data by quarter and shipment type.
